# Track Impression Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `ASP.trackImpression` function to track impressions.

When the page loads, the `ASP.trackImpression` function is called with the required parameters. The response from the server is logged to the console.

## Expectation

When you open the `index.html` file in your browser, you should see the server response for the `trackImpression` call in the developer console.
