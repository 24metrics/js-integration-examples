# Track Click Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `ASP.trackClick` function to track clicks.

When the page loads, the `ASP.trackClick` function is called with the required parameters. The response from the server is logged to the console.

## Expectation

When you open the `index.html` file in your browser, you should see the server response for the `trackClick` call in the developer console.
